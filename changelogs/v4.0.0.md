## v4.0.0 [WIP]

**New feature**

-   pdf-js v4 and later versions are now supported. However, the legacy build of pdf-js is no longer supported.

-   Compatible with React Server Components

**Breaking change**

The `Worker` is moved to `@react-pdf-viewer/worker`:

_Install_

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev @react-pdf-viewer/worker
```

_Use the worker_

```tsx
// Before v4.0.0
import { Worker } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';

// v4.0.0
import { Worker } from '@react-pdf-viewer/worker';
```

-   Provide a new hook to set the state without worrying about whether the component is unmounted. This is useful when updating internal states after an async operator like fetching data:

```js
import { useSafeState } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';

const [state, setState] = useSafeState(initialValue);

fetchData().then((data) => setState(data));
```

**Improvements**

-   Implemente a new mechanism to position portal components like Modals, Popovers, and Tooltips. If the desired position causes an overflow, the component will automatically determine the best position to ensure the layout isn't broken.

-   Up until now, pressing the Escape key would close all open popovers and modals. But we've made a change to this behavior. From now on, pressing Escape will only close the topmost popover or modal.

**Bug fix**

-   Render the initial page without loading the document completely
-   The loading spinner keeps showing forever when we enter full-screen mode
